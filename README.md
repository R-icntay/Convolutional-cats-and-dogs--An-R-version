# Convolutional cats and dogs: An R version

Hello! Welcome to the sixth R code walkthrough of the series [Machine Learning Foundations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Z9TRANg4c0&list=PLOU2XLYxmsII9mzQ-Xxug4l2o04JBrkLV) where Laurence Moroney,a Developer Advocate at Google working on Artificial Intelligence, takes us through the fundamentals of building machine learned models using TensorFlow.

In this episode, Episode 6, we take what we learned about Convolutional Neural Networks in the previous few episodes and apply them to a computer vision scenario that was a Kaggle challenge not long ago: building a classifier for cats and dogs!

Like the previous R Notebooks, this Notebook tries to replicate the Python Notebook used for this episode.

You can find the R blog post of this code on [Rpubs](https://rpubs.com/eR_ic/mlr_6).
